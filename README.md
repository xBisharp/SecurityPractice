I used these C exercises to practice binary exploitation using pwndbg, a powerful GDB extension for debugging and reverse engineering. The goal is to get hands-on experience with buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and other classic exploit techniques by working through small, vulnerable C programs. These challenges focus on memory corruption, stack overflows, and format string bugs, with pwndbg-enhanced debugging to make analyzing and exploiting them easier.
